## üôè Acknowledgments

I want to give a big thank you to **Bro Code** for creating the original 12-hour Java course that inspired this repository.  
The course is freely available on YouTube: [Java Full Course for free ‚òï (2025)](https://youtu.be/xTtL8E4LzTQ?si=091uJaNYsJn41NCy)

This repository is based on that course, but I have added my own explanations, extra examples, and exercises to better understand the concepts and tailor the learning experience to my personal style.
